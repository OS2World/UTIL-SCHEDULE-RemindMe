== Revision History ================

Version 1.00 - initial release
	     - Since this is the initial release, I encourage EVERYONE to
	       send me their questions, comments and suggestions.  I want to
	       continue to develop this application but am in need of your
	       input.  Please send your comments to my email address:
	       eaw@cs.purdue.edu
Version 1.01 - fix for to-do list.  When the list got too large, memory
	       corruption would occur and the application would crash
	     - "Ask before delete event" option added
	     - the day of the week an event is scheduled for is now displayed
	       when editing a calendar event (now you can reschedule an event
	       and know what date it will be on)
	     - max length of reminder title changed from 80 to 256 characters
	       (Note that this is through dynamic allocation so no extra 
	       memory is really used if the event title is not totally filled)
	     - max number of events per calendar changed from ~250 to 300
	     - button added to "event an edit" dialog to launch the OS/2 sound
	       recorder.  This was provided for those users who want to record
	       their own reminders as WAV files.  Once recorded, simply 
	       specify the resulting WAV file to be played at ReminderTime.
	       have them played later.
	     - misc. optimizations and speed-ups
Version 1.02 - Changed "Exit..." menu entry to "Exit" to confirm with style 
               guidelines for applications with menus
             - In versions 1.00 and 1.01, under certain circumstances, if you
               edit events, the reminder option would turn off and never
               turn itself back on.  While closing the application and 
               restarting it would fix the problem, that problem has been 
               fixed in this release
             - RemindMe now watches for midnight, and when hit, advances the
               day pointer and redraws the calendar automatically (for those
               who don't turn their computers off at night!)
             - the event title is now highlighted when entering the modify
               event dialog.  This allows rapid changing of the text title
               when creating a new event
             - revised dialog box for new "90's look" ;)
             - added option so each item in the todo list can be prefixed
               by the date, time or date and time of event
             - fixed calendar color options dialog so that when choosing a new
               color, the dialog title actually fits the color you are choosing
             - added an option to allow you to display the days from the
               previous month and the following month which fill the displayed
               calendar.  Using this, there will be no blank day spots.  You 
               will be able to see those days (from either the preceeding or 
               following month).  Double click editing and quick reminder
               still work on these days.  Events on these days are not
               specially highlighted, though.  You need to move to that month 
               to see highlighting.
             - added corresponding option to enable/disable the display of
               previous/following month days on calendar
             - added corresponding option to change the colors for the display
               of previous/following month days on calendar
             - added optional clock to upper left hand corner of calendar 
               window
             - added way for an event to be rescheduled 1 to 180 days later
               after it is marked as done.  Using this, you can have events
               reschedule themselves every day, every other day, every week, 
               every 6 weeks, etc.  Any value 1 to 180 days can be used.
               Setting to 0 disables this feature (and is the default).
             - User set to do list colors are now correctly saved and restored
             - To Do list now added to task list (window jump list)
             - added keyboard accelerators for saving the current calendar (F2)
               and for exiting the application (Alt+F4)
             - Enlarged previous, current and next month control buttons
             - "Jump to date" (F7) menu option added to quickly jump to a date
             - added an ASCII print subsystem which prints monthly calendar and 
               the todo list for today, the week or the month (or none at all).

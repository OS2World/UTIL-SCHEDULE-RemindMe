	    RemindMe -- An OS/2 Calendar and Scheduling Application
       Written By Eric A. Wolf - Copyright (C) 1995 - All Rights Reserved

 This program is SHAREWARE!  Please read the registration information at the
  end of this document for details on how to register your copy of RemindMe

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================


== Introduction ============

RemindMe is a full-featured and very flexible calendar and scheduling
application for OS/2 2.x and Warp.  You can view the months of the year and
any scheduled events quickly and easily.  Simply gliding the cursor over a day
on the calendar will present the user with a synopsis of all the events
scheduled for that day.  Editing any of the events for a given date only
involves a double click.

In additional to its ease of use and flexibility, RemindMe also provides an
intelligent To-Do list.  The To-Do list looks ahead and reminds you of upcoming
items you've scheduled.  You can be reminded of upcoming events well before
they are actually due (and without having to sift through the many days
and events of a calendar).  These items are presented in a second, strictly
optional window the user can place and size totally independent of the
calendar.  Also included is an event reminder that provides an additional
(optional) visual and/or audio reminder as events come closer to their
scheduled due date.

The program is easy to use and very flexible.  Both fonts and colors can be
set to a user's preference.  Preview areas show you what your changes will
look like before they are made.  The program can be adjusted to any size or
simply configued to sit on your desktop and remain small and out of the way.
All settings and preferences are also remembered and restored whenever the 
program is launched.  This program is also much smaller and faster than IBM's 
calendar/PIM application.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Installation ============

If you are installing RemindMe for the first time, please continue to the next
paragraph.  If you are simply upgrading RemindMe, make copies of all your old
calendar initialization files.  Then, delete ALL the files associated with the
older version of RemindMe, unzip this newer version and copy all your previous
calendar files back into that directory.  Your older calendar files are
supported by all newer versions of RemindMe.  Once you have upgraded RemindMe,
you may skip to the "Using RemindMe" section below.

Installing RemindMe is simple.  Read the README file and once you agree to
register the product if you continue to use it, unzip the second zipfile,
REMINDME.ZIP by typing:

  pkunzip -d REMINDME.ZIP  (if you are using PKUNZIP)

  -or-

  unzip REMINDME.ZIP       (if you are using UNZIP)

Once unzipped, simply go to an OS/2 command prompt and type INSTALL from the
same directory where you unzipped the files.  That will invoke a REXX script
that will create a RemindMe program object/icon on the desktop for you to
use to start the application.  In addition to the American English version
of the program, an international English version of RemindMe is also included 
to provide support for 24 hour time and international date format.

To immediately start RemindMe, double click the program object on the
desktop.  To make RemindMe start every time you boot OS/2, drag the
object (or a copy/shadow thereof) to the startup folder that is found in
the OS/2 system folder.

(NOTE:  Rmember, you should proceed to unzip the second zipfile ONLY if you 
	agree to the registration requirements presented both in the README 
	file and in the registration text at the end of this document.)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Using RemindMe ==============

Start RemindMe by double clicking its program icon.  If you are using RemindMe
for the first time, the application will alert you that it cannot find a
default calendar file.  This is normal operation and you should click OK to
continue.  This is included as a safety measure in the event that your default
file cannot be loaded in the future.

Upon starting RemindMe you will see two windows, the calendar window and the
to-do list window.


== The Calendar ============

In one of the windows you should see a calendar.  By default, it comes up
with the current date.  Note that calendar is scaled to the size of the 
window it is in.  So, resizing the window will also automatically resize 
the calendar in it.

Notice that moving the mouse cursor over any date on the calendar shows you 
the events scheduled for that day in the lower right portion of the calendar.  
This feature is called the "Quick Reminder".  It will be discussed in more 
detail later.  Also notice that double clicking any date on the calendar 
brings up the list of scheduled events (if any) for that particular day.  
From that window, you can choose to add, delete or modify events for that 
day.


Changing the Calendar's Date
----------------------------
 - To go back one month - Using the mouse, click the left arrow (which is to 
   the right of the current month name and year displayed at the top of the
   calendar).  This moves you backward one month.  
   
 - To go forward one month - Click the right arrow (which is to the right of 
   the current month name and year displayed at the top of the calendar).  
   This moves you forward one month.  
   
 - To return to today's date - Click the center diamond to return to the
   current month and year.

 - You may also select the Jump To Date... menu option to manually enter
   a date to jump to.

See "Customizing the Application" for details on how you can customize
various settings of the calendar to better fit your life and work habit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Events on The Calendar ======================

The calendar, itself, isn't much useful unless you can start entering your
own dates on it.  This section describes that process in detail.

Adding a new event
------------------
There are two ways to add a new event.  The first method is through the 
to-do list.  If you double click below any existing items in the to-do list, 
a new item will be created.  The second, alternative method, requires you to 
double click the day on the calendar you wish the event to occur and select 
new event from the popup window.  See "Editing an event" below for complete
information on how to fill in this new event.

Deleting an existing event
--------------------------
To delete an event, first double click the day on the calendar this event
resides on.  Next, select the event from the list box by single clicking on
it.  Now, select the delete event button.  Confirm your request to delete
the item and it will be permanently removed from your calendar.

Modifying an existing event
---------------------------
There are two ways to modify an existing event.  The first method is through 
the to-do list.  If you double click any to-do list item, it will immediately
be presented for editing.  The second method requires you to double click 
over the day where the event occurs.  Now, either select the event from the 
list with a double click or select the item you wish to modify with a single 
click and then press the modify event button.  Please see the "Editing an 
event" information below for instructions on how to fill in a new event.

Editing an event
----------------
When you edit a calendar event, either when create a new event or edit an
existing event, there are a number of things you can set.

 - Item Name:  Enter an appropriate title for your event here.  Names can be
   up to 256 characters in length.

 - Mark Item as completed:  Check this box if the item has already been 
   done.  This helps the to-do list decide if it needs to put the item on
   your to-do list or not.  When you are creating a new event, you probably
   don't want to check this box!
 
 - Item Date:  Click the up or down arrows of the spin buttons to set the
   date and time of the event.  The spin controls automatically wrap around
   when their limits are exceeded.  The date and time correspond to the
   date and time this event is supposed to occur.  For events that have
   no clock time (but only a date) associated with them, like a birthday,
   you can leave the clock at 12:00am (or 00:00 hours on a 24-hour clock).

 - Repitition Options:  Here you have two options you can perform.  Usually,
   the events you schedule are for a unique date and time.  However, if you
   wish, you can schedule events to occur every month or every year (or even
   every month of every year).  Checking these boxes toggle when events are 
   scheduled.  If neither of these boxes are checked, the event will occur 
   only for the specific date and time given.

 - To-Do List Options:  If you wish to be reminded of this event on your
   to-do list, check the "show on To-do list" box.  If this box is checked, 
   you should also set the number of days in advance you want this item to 
   appear on your to-do list.  Set this number by using the up and down 
   arrows of the spin control.  If you have a birthday on your calendar and 
   you want to be reminded 2 weeks ahead of time so you can go buy a gift, 
   set this value to 14 (14 days = 2 weeks).

 - Reminder Options:  In addition to displaying an event on the to-do list,
   you can also have an additional reminder window pop-up at a selected time
   prior to the event.  If you wish to have an additional reminder, check the
   "Event Reminder" box.

   Next, select if you wish to be notified minutes or days before the event 
   occurs.  Once you select one of the two options, select the number of 
   minutes (or days) in advance you want the reminder.  The number of minutes
   before is computed by using the time of the event and subtracting the 
   number of minutes you specify.  It is similarly calculated if you wish
   to be notified a number of days prior to an event.

   You have three options for the types of reminder you can have.  You can
   have an audio only reminder.  This type of reminder will play a user
   selectable sound as a reminder for an event.  Or, you can have a reminder
   window pop-up (with no sound) prior to an event.  Lastly, you can have
   both a reminder window and an associated sound played for an event
   reminder.  You can select which type of reminder you want by clicking
   one of the three reminder-type radio buttons.
   
 - Reminder Sound Button:  Every new calendar event is, by default, assigned
   to play DEFAULT.WAV as its sound file.  While you can copy a new sound
   file over the DEFAULT.WAV file, you can also specify a new sound file by
   pressing this button.  You will then be presented with a file dialog.
   Use this dialog to find the sound file you wish to play and click OK when
   you have selected it.  The sound file you select will be the one that
   plays when an event reminder appears.

 - Launch OS/2 Sound Recorder Button:  If your sound card allows you to
   record and you have an appropriate microphone attached to it, this
   button is an easy link to IBM's sound recorder application.  You can
   use the record a reminder to yourself and then specify the recorded
   WAV file by specifying it using the Reminder Sound Button.  Now,
   when your reminder comes due, your audio reminder will be played.

When you are done editing an event, the calendar and the to-do list will 
automatically be updated to reflect your changes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== The To-Do List ==============

The To-Do list is managed by RemindMe.  It takes the current date and displays
all upcoming (or past due) events that you have appropriately marked on the
to-do list.  If you have marked an item to appear on the to-do list only one
day before it occurs, then RemindMe will only put that item on the to-do list
at that time.  Items past due (items due before the current date but not
marked as done) will also be displayed.

Items on the to-do list can be modified, as well.  To edit an item on the
to-do list, simply double click that item.  The data for that item will then
be displayed and readied for modification.  Data from the to-do list can
be moved to the global clipboard by selecting it with the first mouse button
and using the keyboard shortcuts described in your OS/2 manual for various
cut and copy options.  Note that data cannot be pasted into the to-do list 
(you will need to add a new event on the calendar in order to add an item
to your to-do list).

The To-do list is a separate (and independent) window from the calendar.
It can be sized and placed independent of the calendar.  See "Customizing the 
Application" for details on how you can customize various settings of the 
to-do list to better fit your life and work habit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Reminders =========

As described in 'Reminder Options:' under the "Editing Events" heading
above, reminders are used to provide an additional reminder for upcoming
events.  They can be audible reminders, visual reminders, or reminders
that contain both an audio and visual component.  When a reminder "goes off", 
one of three things can happen:

(1)  (audible option) A user specified sound will play and then that event 
		      will be mark as completed automatically
(2)  (visual option) A window will pop-up (over whatever you are currently 
		     working on) reminding you of the event
(3)  (both option) Both a sound will play and a window will pop-up to remind 
		   you of the event

If you choose a window display (either visual or both options), then you
will have several choices.  You can immediately mark the item as done and
be done with it.  Or, you can choose to revise the event (which means you
can reschedule it, turn off the reminder part of it, etc).  You can choose
to erase the event, as well.  (Exercise caution!!  Once pressed, the item
will immediately (and irreversibly) by erased!!)

Lastly, you can choose to defer the reminder.  If you specified the reminder
appear minutes before the event, you can defer the reminder by a definable
number of minutes.  If the reminder, appears days before the event, you can
defer the reminder to appear the next day (tomorrow).

The number of minutes a reminder snoozes can be set by referring to the
"Customizing the Application" section below.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Customizing The Application ===========================

This section details how one may customize RemindMe by selecting different
fonts, colors and options for the application.  Any and all customizations 
you make will be recorded when you save your calendar file and will be
restored next time you use that calendar.

Calendar Options
----------------
There are a number of different options you can customize for the calendar.
The best way to see what effect each of these has is to simply toggle their
status and notice the change in the preview area.  The available options are:

 - There are 3 different choices in "Date Placement".  Your selection here
   determines the orientation of the date in each day area.  if you are
   confused, clicking different choices here will quickly reveal its 
   function.
 
 - "Draw 3D Calendar", when enabled, draws the calendar in a 3D fashion.
   It uses all 3 calendar colors (light, medium and dark) to give the
   calendar a 3D look.  When this feature is not enabled, only the 
   calendar's dark color is used in drawing.
 
 - Checking "Draw Border Around Day #" will draw a small box around the 
   day number for each day of the month.  Note that this feature is not
   enabled when the date is centered in each day area.

 - Enabling "Draw lines between days" will draw a box around each different
   day of the month.  If not enabled, no box will be drawn.

 - "Highlight current date", when enabled, will draw a thick square around
   the current date on the calendar.  This is often helpful to quickly
   remind you what the date is.

 - Checking "Abbreviate month name" will display the abbreviated month name
   when drawing the calendar versus using the full month name when this
   option is not checked.
 
 - Checking "Label days of the week" will cause the days of the week to be
   printed on your calendar.

 - If "Abbreviate days of the week" is enabled, the days of the week (when
   displayed), will be abbreviated.  If not, their full text will be used
   to describe them.  This is useful if you want to display the days of the
   week but you like a small-sized calendar.

 - Enabling "Use quick reminder" will enable the quick reminder feature.
   That features provides you a quick summary of the days events by simply
   passing mouse cursor over a given day.  Not checking this item disables
   this feature.
 
 - Checking "Remind for completed events" will remind of you events in your 
   quick reminder summary even if they have been marked as completed.  This 
   option is only valid if "Use quick reminder" is enabled.  If once you
   mark an item as done you longer want to see it on your quick reminder,
   simply uncheck this option.

To-Do List Options
------------------
 - The only option besides colors, which are described below in "Changing
   Colors", is the show to-do list option.  If you would prefer NOT to use
   the to-do list, clear the checkmark in this field.

Reminder Options
----------------
 - "Ask before delete event", when enabled, will prompt the user before
   deleting any events from the calendar.  Clearing this item will cause
   items that the user wants deleted to be IMMEDIATELY removed.

 - "The number of minutes a reminder should snooze" refers to the exact
   number of minutes an event reminder should hide itself until it 
   re-appears.  This is invoked whenever the user chooses to defer a
   reminder (by minutes)

 - "The number of minutes between playing reminder sound due to inactivity"
   refers to the number.  When an event reminder pops up (and if it has its
   audio enabled), it will play the user specified sound file.  After the
   number of minutes specified here, if the user does not interact with the
   popped up event window, the sound will be repeated.  Enter 0 to prevent 
   the sound from being played more than once.

 - "Default number of days in advance to display a to-do list item on the
   to-do list" is the default number given to all newly created events.
   This value specifies the number of days prior to the scheduled date of
   an event should it be displayed on your to-do list.  Note that this is
   only a default value and can still be changed when an item is created.

Changing Colors
---------------
 - Both the colors for the calendar and the to-do list can be altered to
   better fit your tastes.  Under the Options menu, select either the
   to-do list or calendar option (depending on which colors you want to
   change).  Then, click the Change Colors button.

   Calendar Colors - there are a number of colors to modify for the calendar.
   You will be presented with a window with a host of pushbuttons and a 
   small, sample calendar that will display any of the changes you make
   (and before they are made to the real calendar).  To modify a color, 
   simply select the corresponding push button.  Note that the changes
   you make will appear in the calendar preview area to show what effect
   they will have when applied to the real calendar.

   To-Do List Colors - the to-do list only has two colors.  A color for the
   background of the to-do list and a color for the text itself in the list.
   Both of these colors can be modified.

Changing Fonts
--------------
 - You may change the font of either the to-do list or the calendar by 
   opening the font palette in the system setup (found in the OS/2
   system folder) and dragging and dropping a new font over either of 
   the two program windows.  This change will be remembered the next time 
   you start the application.  For more information on using drag and drop
   fonts, please see your OS/2 documentation.

Hiding Window Controls
----------------------
 - You may hide the window controls (titlebar, menubar, minimize and maximize 
   and the system menu button) by double clicking with the 2nd mouse button
   over either the to-do list or the calendar window.  This helps your
   windows occupy less space.  You may double click (again using the 2nd 
   mouse button) to restore the controls.  
   
 - When the controls are hidden, you may still move a window by holding
   the 2nd mouse button and moving the cursor while over the cursor is over
   the window.  The window is placed when the 2nd mouse button is released.

 - When the controls are hidden, you may still access the menus of the
   application if you have a 3 button mouse and a mouse driver which
   supports your 3 buttons.  Click the 3rd button on your 3 button mouse 
   and a pop-up menu with all the options found in the normal application 
   menubar will appear.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Advanced Tips and Techniques ============================

 - It is often useful to size the calendar window down and keep it on your
   desktop for constant reference.  When down-sizing the calendar window, it
   is helpful to place the date in the center of the day area and toggling
   OFF any lines that may be drawn.  You should also toggle OFF the quick
   reminder feature since the calendar will probably be too small to see
   any event summaries.  All of these settings can be altered by selecting 
   the Options|Calendar... item on the menubar.

   It is also convenient to drag the program object (or a shadow thereof) to 
   the OS/2 startup folder so that RemindMe is started whenever your system 
   is booted.

 - You may supply a single command line argument to RemindMe when starting it.
   The single argument should be the complete pathname of a calendar file you
   wish to open at run-time.  If no argument is specified, the default calendar
   file (DEFAULT.CAL), will be loaded when the application is launched.

 - The DEFAULT.WAV file is the default sound file given to all new events.
   It is found in the same directory as the REMINDME.EXE executable.  You
   may find it useful to copy your favorite .WAV file over this file.  That
   way, you won't have to override the default sound file each time you
   make a new event.

 - Everytime you load a calendar file, a copy of it is stored in a file 
   called BACKUP.CAL.  That way, in the event something happens to your
   system while running RemindMe, you still have a copy of your old
   calendar file.
 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Revision History ========================

(The revision history from RemindMe's inception to its current release is
 contained in the HISTORY.TXT file that should have come with this archive
 file...  Please contact the system administrator from the site in which you
 obtained this archive if you did not receive it or any other RemindMe files!)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Source Code ===========

This program comes complete with the entire source code that generated it.
Please note the following restriction:

   RemindMe's source code is to be modified by the author alone.  The source
   code is provided as a learning tool ONLY!  No modifications may be made
   to it to reproduce a same or similar product.  The copyright remains that
   solely of the author and the program is protected under both United States 
   and International Copyright Laws.

The complete source code for this program can be found in the SOURCE
directory that was created when you uncompressed this program.  It was
developed on Borland's C++ for OS/2.  A project file (REMINDME.PRJ) has been
provided to facilitate your working with these files.  Each source file
is documented and you should review the code with some good OS/2 references
in hand (PM references, API reference, etc.)  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Distribution of RemindMe ========================

You are free to distribute RemindMe to whomever and however you wish as long
as the following conditions are satisified:

  -  RemindMe should ALWAYS be distributed in its entirety.  This includes
     all documentation, executables, and source files.  Under no circumstances
     should RemindMe be distributed without all of its original files.
     Distribution of RemindMe (in any way possible!) is strongly encouraged
     both by individuals and software houses!

  -  RemindMe's source code is to be modified by the author alone.  The source
     code is provided as a learning tool ONLY!  No modifications may be made
     to it to produce a same or similar product.  The copyright remains that
     of solely the author and the program is protected under both United States 
     and International Copyright Laws.

  -  If you use RemindMe, you MUST register it (directions for doing so
     follow this section of the text).  "Use" includes both the actual
     use of the RemindMe application program -and/or- using the source code 
     as a reference for your own works.  If you use the source as a reference, 
     please register your copy ($10.00 is cheaper than any book you can buy
     on OS/2 programming and what is going to teach you as much??)  
     
  -  Government and site licenses can be granted at a discounted rate.  Please
     inquire for more details.

  -  Remember, if you like the program (even if you don't care much for the 
     source code) you should still register!!


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

== Registration ============

If you like RemindMe, or perhaps, you enjoy having the complete source code
for an OS/2 PM program to aid you in writing your own programs, I ask you to
register your copy of the program.  The registration cost is only $10.00 and
it will ONLY be with your support that I continue to develop for OS/2, and
especially, provide the complete source code for any of my works.

You can register your copy of RemindMe with me for only $10.00.  Please send 
your registration payment as a check or money order (US funds only) to:

If you are MAILING your registration BEFORE April 20, 1995, please send to:
			Eric A. Wolf
			498 Wiley Hall NW
			West Lafayette, Indiana  47906-4223

Or, if you are MAILING your registration ON or AFTER April 20, 1995, send to:
			Eric A. Wolf
			1630 North Johnson Street
			South Bend, Indiana  46628-2936

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Overseas registrations may be sent by simply including $10 US currency 
   with your registration form.  The costs of getting an international
   money order can be prohibitively high.  Often times, the cost of getting 
   the international money order is more than the registration fee.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

I want to encourage everyone to start writing applications for OS/2, no
matter how simple or complex.  That is why I am providing the source code 
with this program.  If you've never developed for OS/2 before, now is your
time to start and you have this to look off of to get you going.

Please note, however, I provide the source code as-is and as a learning tool
for aspiring programmers.  Please do NOT modify the source code and re-release 
an exact or similar product.  The source is provided solely as a learning 
device.  The $10.00 registration fee is cheaper than any OS/2 programming
book and what I provide is a complete, functional OS/2 PM application and 
ALL component source files that comprise it (how many books do that?)

If the response is good enough, and only if it is good enough, I will continue 
to develop products and ship the source code along with them.

I will answer no questions about the source code of the program from an
individual until a registration payment has been received.  Once registered,
source questions can be directed to me via electronic mail only:

		 internet:     eaw@cs.purdue.edu

If you have general comments or questions about the program, you may also
send the electronic address above.  Thanks!

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Remember if you like RemindMe and use  it or if you use or plan to use the
    source code as a reference  for your own works, please register today!
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  My thanks to those of you who have registered!  I appreciate your support!
